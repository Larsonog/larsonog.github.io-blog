## Disco 
Big things have happened! I met with Dr. Goadrich before our meeting this week and we were able to send the file path from one page to another. I was getting closer to finally getting this issue completed! During our usual Disco meeting, I was able to save the file path with the rest of the artwork information and now it appears in the Gallery view!!!! This is absolutely amazing and I am so happy that I was finally able to sort it out. It's times like these that I really enjoy coding (it's like putting that last piece in the puzzle and you get to see the completed picture). Now I just need to work with Dr. Goadrich to move the Gallery info from the local Database to a cloud server so the website can go online. I need to email the client back and let her know the progress has been made! Yippee. 

## More important news
I was recently inducted into Phi Beta Kappa, Psi Chi (Psychology Honors Society), and Pi Sigma Alpha (Politics Honors Society). Additionally, I was informed that I recieved Distinction in Odyssey. I am truly honored by all of these accomplishments and feel as though all the work I have been doing has paid off. These last couple of weeks has felt like a whirlwind and I'm feeling a roller coaster of emotions everyday.
