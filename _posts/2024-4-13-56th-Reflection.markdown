## The Eclipse!

Here are some pictures from the event! Seeing Totality was amazing! The weather got cooler, it appeared like it was evening (even though it was the middle of the afternoon), and everything got so quiet. I'm really glad I was able to be a part of this event. Dr. Renshaw let us play space inspired tunes. 

## Disco 
I was able to get the image to save to the local directory! Yay!!! Suprisingly it only works if the image upload is on it's own page and not on the same page as the artwork information. Now I need to find a way to save the file path so it can be referenced later. I tried passing the file path information through the url but that isn't working. I'm sure there is a much easier way, I'll probably meet with Dr. Goadrich again just to speed it along.
