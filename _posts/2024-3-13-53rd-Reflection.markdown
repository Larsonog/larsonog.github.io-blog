Still no progress on the image file upload. I've tried to follow a couple tutorials and look at stackoverflow but everything is out of date! So far nothing is working but, I've started to dive into the code and pull it a part. 

I thought the WebImage library would help but no dice (#sad).

Next week is spring break and I'm so excited! It's definetely a much needed break for everyone! It's been pretty obvious that everyone is running on fumes. 

Before the break I sent an email to our client about an email and password for the admin side of the website. I have that now and so I can make sure she is the only one who can access it. Which reminds me, I made it so only the client can log in. It was a pretty easy fix but an extremely necessary one.
