## Spring Break week 
This is my last spring break and man did  it fly by. I am a part of the Hendrix Ultimate Frisbee team. We drove to South Carolina for a frisbee tournament. We won 4 games and lost 3. And the games that we lost were very close. I am so happy that I've been a part of the frisbee team for the past 4 years. It's a great way to exercise and meet great friends. 

## Disco 
Now as I am getting back into Disco work, I have to remember where I was. Last week I remember saying that I'm close to the solution. Next time before I take a break, I will be taking extensive notes so I can remember where I am. 

Dr. Goadrich suggested I look for a repository on Github that had a similar function. I found one! And I forked it to my repository so I can run it on my end. Hopefully this will be the break through I was looking for. 

I might still need to meet with Dr. Goadrich and work with him.
