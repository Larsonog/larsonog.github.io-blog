## Disco 
I have been working with the repository I found on Github [(linked here)](https://github.com/Larsonog/image_upload_watermark). It works great and it saves the images to the local directory instead of using a cloud server database. However, I am having a difficult time implementing it. I met with Dr. Goadrich and we were able to get part of the upload funcitoning with in the project but it's not fully functional. 

## Other
I have also been very busy recently. I have a lot of Wind ensemble events coming up (Eclipse Concert and the President's Inaugeration). I am also becoming increasingly aware that the semester is coming to a close and I will have to leave college soon.
